# TaskCluster RFCs

* [Issues](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/issues) are RFCs in development, not yet in the proposal stage;
* [pull requests](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/pulls) contain proposed RFCs; and
* [the repo](rfcs/) holds RFCs on which we have reached consensus.

See [our roadmap](roadmap.md) for a more general idea of where we are headed.

## Background

**What**: Ideas and projects of the TaskCluster Team, in one discoverable place.

**Why**: This repo serves as a place to coordinate design and architecture, so that everyone can participate and past discussions are accessible to everyone.

**How**: Each idea gets an [issue](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/issues) and discussion takes place there to turn the idea into a proposal and eventually implement it -- or to agree not to act on the idea. See [mechanics](mechanics.md) for more detail.
