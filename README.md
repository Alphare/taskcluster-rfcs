# TaskCluster RFCs

This repo exists to house proposals for changes to TaskCluster and allow the team to manage their transition from ideas to designs to plans to completed (or to deciding against).

The Git repo itsel fhas no real content -- the interesting stuff is in the [issues](https://github.com/djmitche/taskcluster-rfcs/issues) and the [project](https://github.com/djmitche/taskcluster-rfcs/projects/1).

## Mechanics

### I Have an Idea!

Open an issue! Issues should either be more than a week's work, or potentially controversial.  Anything else can just be filed as a bug (assigned to yourself, of course).

Ideas should have
 * a pretty specific goal: a user story ("Users can..."), dependency ("This will allow ..") or a completion condition ("All services ..");
 * some vague idea of how this might be accomplished, or a few alternatives; and
 * a list of required resources (time, money, people)

You can leave the issue un-assigned.  Shop the issue around to the team to try to get a diversity of opinions on it.

### I Have an Opinion!

Comment on the issue.  The issues themselves are intended to record the discussion on the issue, so that's the right place.

As decisions are made, update the first comment to represent that consensus.

### I Think We Should Do This!

Work with the team to get consensus, and update [the project](https://github.com/djmitche/taskcluster-rfcs/projects/1) with the result of that consensus.

### I'm Working on This!

Update the first comment in the issue to point to any related stuff - bugs, repos, etherpads, gists, whatever.
